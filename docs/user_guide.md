## Backup and restore

All the data generated by the server is located in the `data/` directory:

 - The server configuration (in `profile.toml`)
 - The server secrets
 - The SQLite3 database
 - The uploaded media

Restoring is as easy as adding your backed up `data/` directory into a fresh deployment.
